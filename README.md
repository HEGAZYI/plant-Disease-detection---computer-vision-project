# Crop Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to classify corn leaf images into four categories: Healthy, Northern Leaf Blight, Gray Leaf Spot, and Common Rust. A CNN and traditional models (KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression) are compared for their performance.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `project.ipynb` to train models and evaluate results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset includes images of corn leaves with varying health conditions. [[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nafishamoin/new-bangladeshi-crop-disease/code)]

## Methodology

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was developed to classify leaf images. Additionally,
traditional machine learning models like KNN and Logistic Regression were trained and
evaluated for comparison.

## Models

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

## Results

The CNN achieved superior accuracy compared to traditional models. See the results section in the report for more details.
